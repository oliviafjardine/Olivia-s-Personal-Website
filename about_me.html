                        <p>I was born in a Loudi, a small city in China. At six months old I was adopted by my parents whom raised me in Seattle, Washington for the rest of my 18 years to come. During my childhood years I lived beside my little brother, Ronin, who is 6 years behind me. Up until seventh grade, I grew up with my two tiny, white cloud-looking dogs, Mochi and Marla. two months after they had passed, my family welcomed our new dogs, Minnie and Cocoa, whom I love very much and are my best friends to this day.
